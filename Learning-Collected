Whenever you are using getline(cin, str) and it is not working, so it happens because
something hanged your inputstream unwantedly and so it will be always making problem

The solution of this problem is that always use cin.ignore before calling getline

Example is this 

string str;
cout << "Enter the striung : \n";
cin.ignore(); // Important line to avoid the error
getline(cin, str);
cout << "Your input string is - " << str << endl;
